## 2018 NC Open Pass Partner Prospectus

Greetings!

You are invited to become part of the Triangle&#39;s most exciting and influential communities on civic technology – NC Open Pass.

Forward-thinking technologists, government officials, and community advocates regularly convene to exchange ideas, explore solutions, and identify best practices to improve the way our community can work together. We meet regularly to share ideas and work on projects affecting our community. Throughout the year, we hold conferences to energize, innovate, and improve our quality of life through technology.

Whether your priority is building your business with local government; supporting tech innovation for social impact; connecting with top coders, designers, and entrepreneurs; or raising the visibility of your products - partnering with NC Open Pass is a way to achieve your goals while practicing corporate, social responsibility.

Partnerships are the way we are able to continue to make progress and gather this unique community of forward-thinkers and doers. The NC Open Pass Co-chairs and planning teams all volunteer their time and energy to create these events and work toward outcome-based goals with our community partners.

We look forward to working with you to explore what type of participation will best meet your goals and we thank you for your support.

About NC Open Pass

Open Raleigh Brigade launched a new initiative in 2016 called   [NC Open Pass](http://ncopenpass.com/). It&#39;s a partnership between North Carolina brigades and the first state-wide open data competition, NC DataPalooza.  NC Open Pass brings together the following events:

- **NC Open Pass DataJam** (March 3-4, International Open Data Day) - Uniting communities through open data is everyone&#39;s business. It goes to economic opportunity, government transparency, and quality of life. This year will be holding a data jam around affordable housing where data analysts, policy people, and non-profits will dig into available data to better understand the triangle&#39;s affordable housing situation.
- **NC Open Pass Community Action Day** (June 9) is a time for public innovation – to brainstorm creative solutions to community problems.
- **NC Open Pass National Day of Civic Hacking** (August 11) - A national, coordinated effort bringing together urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, and community organizers to make their community better. This years event will have a virtual component with all NC Brigades who are part of the Open NC Collaborative.
- **NC Open Pass Civic Camp** (September 21-22, formerly CityCamp NC) - An annual event bringing citizens, government, academia, and businesses together to openly innovate and improve our quality of life through technology.
- **NC Open Pass DataPalooza** (November 8, formerly NC DataPalooza) - An open data competition to catalyze positive community and economic impact with coaching and cash prizes.

_We will also be offering registrations to regional events outside of the Triangle planned by brigades in Asheville, Charlotte, and Greensboro as they are announced._
