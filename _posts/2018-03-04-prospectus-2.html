<p>About NC Open Pass</p>
<p>Open Raleigh Brigade launched a new initiative in 2016 called   <a href="http://ncopenpass.com/">NC Open Pass</a>. It's a partnership between North Carolina brigades and the first state-wide open data competition, NC DataPalooza.  NC Open Pass brings together the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NC Open Pass DataJam</strong> (March 3-4, International Open Data Day) - Uniting communities through open data is everyone's business. It goes to economic opportunity, government transparency, and quality of life. This year will be holding a data jam around affordable housing where data analysts, policy people, and non-profits will dig into available data to better understand the triangle's affordable housing situation.</li>
<li><strong>NC Open Pass Community Action Day</strong> (June 9) is a time for public innovation – to brainstorm creative solutions to community problems.</li>
<li><strong>NC Open Pass National Day of Civic Hacking</strong> (August 11) - A national, coordinated effort bringing together urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, and community organizers to make their community better. This years event will have a virtual component with all NC Brigades who are part of the Open NC Collaborative.</li>
<li><strong>NC Open Pass Civic Camp</strong> (September 21-22, formerly CityCamp NC) - An annual event bringing citizens, government, academia, and businesses together to openly innovate and improve our quality of life through technology.</li>
<li><strong>NC Open Pass DataPalooza</strong> (November 8, formerly NC DataPalooza) - An open data competition to catalyze positive community and economic impact with coaching and cash prizes.</li>
</ul>
